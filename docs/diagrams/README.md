# Diagrams for EMS project

This folder contains high-level diagrams generated from the repository structure. The diagrams are intended to help with architecture reviews and documentation.

- `flowchart.svg` — Basic flowchart showing request → processing → response.
- `component_diagram.svg` — Components (frontend, backend, services, model, storage, DB).
- `sequence_diagram.svg` — Sequence of messages from user upload through inference to response.
- `data_flow_diagram.svg` — Data movement (image bytes, outputs, DB entries, stored artifacts).
- `system_architecture.svg` — Deployment-level view showing optional reverse proxy, backend cluster, model worker and storage.

If you want PNG or higher-fidelity diagrams (PlantUML, draw.io), I can produce PlantUML source or export PNGs. Tell me which diagram you want adjusted or exported.
